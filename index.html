                <p>As a Web developer, We want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material, provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing to the user. In order to do this, We need to know the nuances of Web design and delivery and the various tools and software applications We can use.</p>

        <h1>Develop</h1>
        <h1 >Without Limits</h1>
        <p>Let’s imagine a developer’s life without limits.
            What would we be able to accomplish if we were not victims of time pressure, blockers, inherited code bases, political games or economic distress?
            What if we could dedicate all the time in the world to design and build our solutions with no dependencies blocking our way. Just a clean slate sprinkled with hope and glory in a perfectly functional organisation surrounded by magic money trees. Wouldn’t that be nice?</p>

        <h1 >We're working on it</h1>
        <p>As developers, we like to chase perfection. It is one of the reasons why we can very easily become addicted to refactoring. Refactoring might give you that instant gratification you are probably not getting from your day to day development tasks at work. My advice would be to try and figure out a way to fix this counterproductive behaviour and act in the best interest of your company, your career and your well-being by breaking this highly disruptive infinite loop.</p>
